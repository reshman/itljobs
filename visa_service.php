		<h5> <strong>Qatar Business Visa</strong><br></h5>
		<p>
           If you have one of the countries above citizenship and work for a (or will work for) Qatari company, then you’re eligible for a Qatar business visa. The company is the one responsible for organizing business visas for its workers. This type of visas’ validity is 2 week extendable to 2 other weeks (or more, it depends on the circumstances). If your stay in Qatar surpassed 4 weeks on a business visa, you’ll need an exit visa in order to leave.
		</p>
<!-- Content -->        
		<h5> <strong>Qatar Work Visa</strong><br></h5> 
          <p>  Qatar work visas have a validity of 1-3 months. They are normally organized by your employer in Qatar. Before applying to a Qatar work visa you will need to get a certificate of good conduct, more details on this can be found at
		   <a href="http://www.qatarvisitor.com/index.php?cID=433&pID=1389">Police Clearance Certificates for Qatar.</a> After having arrived to Qatar, your company has to get you a work visa and a resident permit to enable you to work and live there. You’ll need to provide/do the following in order to get the work visa and resident permit:
		</p>
		 <p class="para_left">
			– 		 A normal blood test and a blood type test<br>
			–        Fingerprinting<br>
			–        Health check<br>
			–        Chest X-ray<br>
        </p>
		<p>We recommend performing the above tests in the Doha Clinic situated at the Mirquab Al Jadeed Street.  Added to that, you might have to get a global health checkup before coming Qatar.</p>
		<p>	In order to be sponsored by your employer, you have to have worked for him for at least 2 years. Your employer can also block you from coming to Qatar for 2 years.</p>

		<h5>  <strong>Qatar Visit Visa</strong><br></h5> 
          <p> If you have relatives working in Qatar, you can ask them to sponsor you and get you a Qatar visit visa. This type of visas is valid for an initial 1 month that can be extended to up to 6 months (immediate family) and up to 3 months (other family relatives). If you’re a wife or a child, then the visa can be extended to up to 1 year.<br>
			You will need the following documents in order to be able to get the visit visa to qatar:
		</p>
		 <p class="para_left">
			– 		 2 photographs<br>
			–        Birth/marriage certificate (to prove your relationship to the sponsor)<br>
			–         A letter from your sponsor<br>
			–        Copy of passport<br>
			–        Copy of id<br>
        </p>
		<p>In order to apply for sponsorship, your relative needs to deposit his application at the Gharaffa immigration department.</p>
		
<!-- Content -->		
		<h5> <strong>Qatar Family Visa</strong><br></h5>
          <p> If you work in Qatar, you can sponsor your family to come and live with you. This is different from a visit visa as a family visa doesn’t have an expiration date and your family will be able to live in Qatar as long as you sponsor them. The family sponsor has to arrange his family’s residence permit in advance. The application has to be deposited at the Department Of Labor situated at the C Ring Road. The sponsor needs to provide the following documents:

		   </p>
		 <p class="para_left">
			– 		 Passport photos of the sponsor, the spouse and children<br>
			–         Certified children’s birth certificates, education certificates and marriage certificates.<br>
			–         Bank statement of 6 months’ salary<br>
			–        Approval letter from work<br>
		
        </p>
		<p>Another alternative would be applying for a visit visa for your family then converting it to a residence permit once they arrive.</p>
		<p>Due a change in the<a href="http://www.qatarvisitor.com/index.php?cID=413&pID=1272"> labor law </a> for working women, women now are able to sponsor their children and husbands.</p>

		<h5><strong>Qatar GCC Resident Visa</strong><br></h5>
          <p>  If you’re a GCC resident, you might be able to get an on boarder point visa. The reason why we used the word “might” would be that getting this visa entirely depends on your job. If your profession figures in
		   <a href="http://qatarvisas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/List-of-proffessions-who-can-get-visa-upon-arrival-in-Qatar.docx"> this list</a>, then you’ll be granted the on arrival Qatar GCC resident visa without problems, but if not, you’ll have to apply for it before arriving in Qatar the normal way.
